# Total Recap

In this section, you learned how to:

- Position graphics on the screen

- Use `IF` statements for conditional logic

- Use `REPEAT` to loop through blocks of code

- Use `gfx.Clear` to clear the screen before drawing

- Ensure graphics are always visible on the screen

<!--
## Think about this!

1.  When we were setting the boundaries of the screen, we used the code
    `constant(128-2)` and `constant(64-2)` for the right and bottom
    edges.

    a. Why are we subtracting 2 both times, but we don't subtract
    anything from the top and left edges?

    b. From looking at how its used, can you guess what the `constant`
    keyword does?

## Feeling Adventurous?

1.  Remember what happened when we forgot to clear the screen? What if
    we went a little further with that whole paint program idea? Try
    your hand at making a digital etch-a-sketch.

2.  In some versions of Snake, traveling towards an edge will teleport
    you to the other side instead of stopping you. See if you can make
    this on your own.
